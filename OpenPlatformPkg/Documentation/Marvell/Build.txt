UEFI Build Instructions
=======================

For toolchain versions limitations please refer to edk2 wiki page:
https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Using-EDK-II-with-Native-GCC

Fully supported are gcc4.5 - gcc4.9, so possible {toolchain_name} are:
	- GCC45
	- GCC46
	- GCC47
	- GCC48
	- GCC49

Supported {platform} are:
	- Apn806
	- Armada7040_rz
	- Armada70x0
	- Armada80x0

Supported {target} are
	- DEBUG
	- RELEASE

Build procedure
---------------
1. Prerequisites:

	Clone into edk2 repositories and apply Marvell patches (Please refer to
	Release notes for instructions).

2. Prepare environment:

	2.1 Several packages will be needed to fully set up an edk2 build environment:

			# sudo apt-get install build-essential uuid-dev
			# sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6 lib32z1

	2.2 Set up EDK2 environment

			# source edksetup.sh

	2.3 Build base tools

			# make -C BaseTools

	2.4 Set {toolchain_name}_AARCH64_PREFIX to path to your cross compiler

			# export {toolchain_name}_AARCH64_PREFIX=/path/to/toolchain

		Example:
		--------
			# export GCC48_AARCH64_PREFIX=/opt/gcc-linaro-aarch64-none-elf-4.8-2014.04_linux/bin/aarch64-none-elf-

3. Build EDK2 for selected {platform}:

			# build -a AARCH64 -t {toolchain_name} -b {target} -p OpenPlatformPkg/Platforms/Marvell/Armada/{platform}.dsc

	Example for building edk2 for Armada7040_rz platform with GCC48 for DEBUG:

			# build -a AARCH64 -t GCC48 -b DEBUG -p OpenPlatformPkg/Platforms/Marvell/Armada/Armada7040_rz.dsc
