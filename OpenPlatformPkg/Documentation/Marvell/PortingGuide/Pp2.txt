Pp2Dxe porting guide
--------------------
Pp2Dxe is driver supporting PP2 NIC on Marvell platforms. Following PCDs
are required to operate:

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2PortNumber
  (number of ports/network interfaces)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPhySmiAddresses
  (addresses of PHY devices)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2PortIds
  (identificators of PP2 ports)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2GopIndexes
  (indexes used in GOP operation)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2SharedAddress
  (base address of shared register space of PP2)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2GmacObjSize
  (spacing between consecutive GMAC register spaces)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2GmacBaseAddress
  (base address of GMAC)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2XlgObjSize
  (spacing between consecutive XLG register spaces)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2XlgBaseAddress
  (base address of XLG)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2Rfu1BaseAddress
  (base address of RFU1)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2SmiBaseAddress
  (base address of SMI)

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdPp2ClockFrequency
  (TCLK frequency)

GMAC and XLG addresses are computed as follows:
  address = base_address + obj_size * gop_index
