SATA configuration
------------------
In order to add new SATA device, please refer to document describing
PciEmulation - /path/to/opp/Documenation/Marvell/PortingGuide/PciEmulation.txt

There are also two additional PCDs:

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdSataBaseAddress

Base address of SATA controller register space - used in SATA ComPhy init
sequence.

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdSataMapPortAddress

Boolean indicating if controller on platform needs specific address mapping for
SATA ports. Setting this flag is necessary for CP110-A0 revisions.
